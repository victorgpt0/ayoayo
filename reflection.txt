first step is to initialize the class and make sure it can run code on my terminal with Hello World.

we then need a player class that initializes the player object.

we also need to setup player 1 and 2 to be class members of Ayoayo class throught the setPlayer() method

I thought about using arrays to store the players and their store of seeds instead of using a variable for each. But still the game can only take two players at a time.

Once i got to making the pits, I noticed that I would need 2-Dimensional Arrays if I was to do it in the same way I did the stores so I decided to make them part of player instance variables
